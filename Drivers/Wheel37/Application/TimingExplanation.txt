This text file explains the project timing 

The master is the wheel control. 
It toggles a PWM signal 50% duty , 100 usec wide.
At 50usec it issues a pulse to steering via the UART TX.
Steering will make this a PWM synchronization via INPUT6 

The PWM counts up. Until 50% it is low, rising at 50usec.
This PWM times the periodic interrupt. 
At the period start it sends its status via FSI: 10usec from cycle start must be left for the interface card to read the pevious FSI and reset its receiver. 
Then a flush sequence is followed by status transmission. 
At the end of period, it has ready information from the interface FSI and should read it.
